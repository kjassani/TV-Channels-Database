# TV-Channels-Database

- Redesigned and normalized a MySQL database for a TV channel organizer into a third normal form schema, thereby enhancing data integrity and maintainability. Developed an Entity Relationship (ER) diagram and a Relational Model (RM) which boosted efficiency and simplicity in database management.

- Authored a comprehensive set of SQL scripts that facilitated the creation of new tables, management of Primary and Foreign keys, and standardization of column data types. The data migration from the old tables to the newly structured ones was fully automated, leading to a seamless, error-free data transfer process.

- Implemented advanced SQL functionalities, including the creation of user-friendly views for data presentation and the deployment of triggers to maintain a real-time count of crew members. The final database was successfully consolidated and exported into a runnable SQL file, showcasing end-to-end proficiency in database management.
